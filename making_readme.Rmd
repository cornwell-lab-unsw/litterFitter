## litterFitter: a package for fitting and testing alternative models for single cohort litter decomposition data


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter)

To install run:

```r
  install.packages("devtools")
	devtools::install_github("cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter")
	library(litterfitter)
```
At the moment there is only really one useful function which is `fit_litter` which can fit 6 different types of decomposition trajectories.  

Try:

```r
fit<-fit_litter(time=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6),mass.remaining=c(1,0.9,1.01,0.4,0.6,0.2,0.01),model="weibull",iters=1000)
```
You can see this visually with the `plot_multiple_fits` function:


```{R echo=FALSE fig.keep=TRUE}
plot_multiple_fits(time=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6),mass.remaining=c(1,0.9,0.98,0.4,0.6,0.2,0.01),iters=800)
```
plotting a `litfit` object also works:

```{R echo=FALSE fig.keep=TRUE}
plot(fit)
```
