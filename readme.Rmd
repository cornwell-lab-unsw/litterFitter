[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter?branch=master)

To install run:

```{R,results="hide",warning=FALSE,message = FALSE}
  #install.packages("devtools")
  devtools::install_github("cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter",ref="bootstrap")
  library(litterfitter)
```
At the moment there is one key function which is `fit_litter` which can fit 6 different types of decomposition trajectories.  

```{R,results="hide",warning=FALSE,message = FALSE}
   fit<-fit_litter(time=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6),
   mass.remaining=c(1,0.9,1.01,0.4,0.6,0.2,0.01),
   model="weibull",iters=500)
```

You can visually compare the fits of different non-linear equations with the `plot_multiple_fits` function:

```{R,fig.height=6,results='hide',fig.keep=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message = FALSE}
   plot_multiple_fits(time=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6),
   mass.remaining=c(1,0.9,1.01,0.4,0.6,0.2,0.01),
   model=c("neg.exp","weibull"),iters=500)
```

Calling `plot` on a `litfit` object will show you the data, the curve fit, and even the equation, with the estimated coefficients:

```{R,fig.keep=TRUE}
   plot(fit)
```

The summary of a `litfit` object will show you some of the summary staistics for the fit.

```{R,echo=FALSE,fig.keep=TRUE}
   summary(fit)
```

From this `litfit` object you can then see the uncertainty in the parameter estimate by bootstrapping

```{R,echo=FALSE,fig.keep=TRUE}
   post<-bootstrap.parameters(fit)
   plot(post)
```
