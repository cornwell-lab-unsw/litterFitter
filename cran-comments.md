## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Added \value for predict.litfit.Rd

## Downstream dependencies

stats, grphics, grDevices, methods are a base package and cannot be installed/updated in console.

- plyr installed successfully from source and passed checks (https://github.com/cornwell-lab-unsw/litterfitter/tree/master/r-release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs. NOTEs,

## Submission

This is a new package submission.

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.  One NOTE about the maintainer email which I gather is standard based on: https://mailman.stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2014-March/068497.html
